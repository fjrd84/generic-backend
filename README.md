# NodeJS Backend with Authentication

This project lets a user authenticate locally, or with Facebook, Twitter and Google by using oAuth, by 
means of the passport module.

Once the user is authenticated with one of the aforementioned strategies, he or she can link his profile to 
his other profiles.

It is based [in a scotch.io tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local).

## Instructions

- Install packages: `npm install`
- Change out the database configuration in config/database.js
- Change out auth keys in config/auth.js
- Launch: `node server.js`
- Visit in your browser at: `http://localhost:3200`
